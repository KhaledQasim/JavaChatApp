# JavaChatApp
Simple Chat server that is built using Java

# How to use

Run the Server.java once for the server to start

In different terminals run as many Client.java as you need, you will have to provide a username and password , the password is "password"

The Client will then connect to the Server and can chat with all the other connected Clients.	


# Features

In class Server there is a String array called 'AllowedClients' , this array will only let it's stored IPs connect to the server, since we are running the server and clients locally , '127.0.0.1' is enough
